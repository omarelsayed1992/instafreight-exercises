# Find Backloads, the Next Loads, and the Loads after That

How Digital Freight Forwarding Is Helping Small Carriers Find Backloads, the Next Loads, and the Loads after That
 

There are more than 700,000 carriers in Europe, and 70 percent of those carriers operate less than five trucks. That’s just shy of half a million of these small operators, a formidable force by any accounting, and a critical driver of Europe’s economy. But for all their ubiquity, small carriers have been held back by the segmented nature of the logistics market and their inability to access large portions of Europe’s shipping market.

That’s all changed, thanks to digital freight forwarding, a novel way of connecting small carriers to shipments that would normally be beyond their reach. As this new platform for freight transactions grows, digital freight forwarding is closing the gap for small carriers and leveling the playing field for companies that want to take on additional freight and grow their trucking business.

Are you a good fit?
Thousands of carriers are already taking advantage, and it has never been easier to get onboard than today. Each additional carrier that joins increases the utility of digital freight forwarding and makes it more attractive to shippers. That means more jobs and more volumes for carriers. As a small carrier, you keep your independence and still make all the decisions, but you gain power in numbers.

Here’s how it works
Carriers create profiles on the platform. This is where you can advertise your strengths, such as where you routinely have free capacities, and your drivers are most familiar with the roads and conditions. The more detailed a carrier’s profile is, with details such as the type of trailers, fleet size, and additional equipment, the better the business opportunities are.

In the past, small carriers had no way of communicating these strengths to shippers. Such carriers often lack the infrastructure, sales, and marketing resources, and probably do not speak four different languages which may be required to comfortably communicate with shippers and potential business partners across Europe.

With digital freight forwarding, setting up your profile only takes a few minutes, and suddenly thousands of shippers, theoretically, know exactly what your value is, and where you perform best.

Let’s use a hypothetical example, which we will call Carrier X, a Frankfurt-based carrier with four vehicles that specializes in regional transport around Germany. Carrier X generates most of its revenues by delivering furniture to business customers of independent retailers and warehouses that are located across Germany.

A typical delivery for Carrier X might originate at an auto parts supplier thirty kilometers outside of Frankfurt, drive over 200 kilometers to Stuttgart, where it makes the delivery at a warehouse, and then return to the Frankfurt suburbs for another delivery, or perhaps to the depot at the end of the day. That’s a normal delivery for thousands of truckers, but for a carrier that uses digital freight forwarding, that return trip or the trip to the depot is loaded and utilized.

The drivers at Carrier X have gained an incredible amount of expertise in just in time deliveries and navigating the spaces between factories and warehouses in that part of Germany. With digital freight forwarding, managers from Carrier X can now advertise their free capacity on these return routes.

Suddenly, Carrier X gains access to available shipments near their drop off points which need to be moved in the opposite direction – and that just so happens to be the direction that Carrier X is headed anyway. Simply by signing up, Carrier X doubles its haul with backloads, the next loads and the loads after that.

Getting the wheels turning is as easy as downloading an app and signing up. There’s no investment in equipment, no franchising costs, no advertising costs, or any of the other obstacles that kept small carriers from accessing these markets in the past.

Play to Your Strengths
Small carriers are agile. If you’ve got five trucks, you probably know everything about them, such as which one gets the best mileage, or which one needs an oil change next week. Most small carriers also know which routes operate with the most frequency, and that’s where they want to be.

Online freight plays to those strengths. If a carrier regularly has free capacity in Berlin, the system will show them available loads in Berlin. If there’s an intercity route, built-in algorithms will make sure that carriers see those shipments.

It does not take long to make digital freight forwarding a central part of your business. Carriers can use data from their deliveries to build their strategies. For example, if there are recurring shipments outbound from Berlin, carriers can make more shipments into Berlin, allowing them to take advantage of recurring backloads from that area.

Need for Speed
If you are a small carrier, another thing you know is that every euro counts, and waiting up to four weeks for payment for services rendered wastes resources that you can’t afford. You delivered the goods, and you deserve your money.

Digital freight forwarding makes those lean weeks a thing of the past. Instead, you get paid within 72 hours. That’s just how it works. The online freight forwarder verifies that the shipment has been satisfactorily completed, and makes the payment to the carrier. Moreover, small carriers can manage all their administrative work, invoicing, shipping document management, and much more, saving them thousands of euros in administrative costs.

And if you are worried about computers taking over, don’t worry, the digital freight forwarder has logistics experts on hands to help you sort out those shipments, so there’s always a dispatcher to talk to.

And we mean it when we say that the carrier is always in control. InstaFreight’s algorithms calculate the most competitive “buy now” market price, but if the carrier wants more for the job, they can bid at a higher price or call the dispatcher to discuss it. And if the shipper agrees, then the rest is smooth sailing, with more backloads, the next loads, and the loads after that…
